# Chris's Subway-Builder Datapack

## Overview

This datapack provides a set of structure blocks for various styles of rail
tunnel and rail station, and a "cursor" machine that lets you build these
tunnels and stations.

From inside the cursor machine, you can spawn new tunnels, change the type
of tunnel you're building, or spawn stations (which spawn additional
cursors).

**FIXME** - Pictures and more comprehensive documentation go here.

## Installation

Unpack the following file in your "datapacks" folder to install the
"CJT_Tunnels" datapack:

* `CJT_Tunnels.zip` - Tunnels, stations, and build cursor.

The `.tar` archives have the same content; use whichever you prefer.


*This is the end of the file.*
