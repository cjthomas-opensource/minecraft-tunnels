# Chris's Subway-Builder bug list, feature requests, and abbreviated changelog.


## To-do list and bug list for the current version:

* Placing tunnels, stations, and cursors underwater puts water sources in
every block that can be waterlogged. This includes track and signposts. This
is a crippling problem, but fixing it requires completely changing the way
pieces are placed (placing solid blocks or air and then placing the parts).


## Deferred to future versions:

* Add generated structures, as their own .zip file (so that they're optional).

* Write a script that automatically generates the cursor blocks (and the
versions of the stations that have cursors). This will be necessary for the
water fix (it'd be a massive amount of work to implement by hand).


## Abbreviated changelog:

* 05 Mar 2022 --
First published version of the repository.


*This is the end of the file.*
